Run ./installDebianPackages.sh to install dependencies. Definitely do this before running `make` anywhere.

To run the nodejs server:
Run make in the `NodeJs-Code` folder,
run the command `node server.js` in the `/mnt/remote/node/nodejs-code-copy` folder on the target,
navigate to `192.168.7.2:8088` on your web browser
